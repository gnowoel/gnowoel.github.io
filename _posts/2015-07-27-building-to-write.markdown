I have been always wanting to start a blog but never did it. My life is full of distraction and it's not easy for me to find something to focus on. But maybe that's just an excuse.

When I decided to try again, I faced another problem. There are countless blogging software to choose from: Wordpress, Ghost, Jekyll and many many more. But I'm not familiar with any of them.

I figured out a solution to solve both problems: building a blogging software and writing about it.

The blog is currently powered by Jekyll. My idea is to create a static site generator while I am learning from others. If things are going well, the blog will eventually be running with my own blogging software.

This would be a challenge for me, since my programming skill is rudimentary and I have no idea about how a static site generator works. But I believe it would be a valuable learning experience.

Do we really need another static site generator? You probably don't, but I do.
